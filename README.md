## Running the Project

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the Next.js development server, and you can view your application at `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Build the project for production**:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This will build the project and optimize it for production. The optimized version will be available in the `.next` folder.

3. **Run the production server**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the server to serve the production build.

## Development Workflow

- **Editing Files**: You can edit the TypeScript files in the `src/` folder. Next.js will automatically reload the server to reflect changes.
- **Linting**: The project uses strict TypeScript settings for type safety. If you want to check for linting issues, you can run:

  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

- **Testing**: You can add tests to your project using testing libraries such as Jest or React Testing Library. The project doesn't come preconfigured with testing libraries, so you can set them up as needed.

## Common Commands

- **Start the development server**: `npm run dev`
- **Build the project**: `npm run build`
- **Run the production build**: `npm start`
- **Run the linter**: `npm run lint`
